# FAQ

## What is it? What is its purpose?

JournaLytics is a journaling platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide users with structured feedback and insights on their daily entries, promoting self-reflection, personal growth, and enhanced well-being.

## How Do I Get Started?

On the homepage, you can see a text box where you can enter your entry and then hit submit.

Your entry will be saved and you can even close the app and add more entries later. All the data is saved.

## How Does AI Feedback Work?

The AI Feedback is generated under 3 headings -

1. What You Did Best This Week: Under this section, the AI recognizes your accomplishments and highlights moments of success within your journal entry. It reinforces positive behaviors and achievements.

2. What Can You Improve: In this section, the AI provides constructive insights. It pinpoints areas where you may have faced challenges or where growth opportunities exist. This feedback is geared toward helping you identify and work on areas for self-improvement.

3. Some Tips from My Side: Here, the AI becomes your personalized mentor. Based on the analysis of your entry and the themes it has detected, the AI offers tailored tips and suggestions. It provides guidance on how to build on your strengths and overcome challenges, empowering you to navigate life's journey more effectively.

We recommend that you make at least 3 entries for accurate feedback but, our system can also work with a minimum of 2 entries.

All of your generated feedbacks can be found in the Past results section. You can navigate to that section by clicking on “Show past results” on the homepage.
